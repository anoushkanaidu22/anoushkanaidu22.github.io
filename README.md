Hi, I’m Anoushka Naidu! I’m from Boise, Idaho and currently studying computer science with a concentration in computer graphics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I’ll be in New York City this summer interning at Plaid as a software engineer intern. 

This website is currently a work in progress. Please check back in the future for updates!
